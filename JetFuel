This program takes in the total gallons of jet fuel a consumer want to purchase
and calculates the liters, barrells of oil, CO2 emissions, BTUs, pounds, and cost
of the total fuel that the consumer want to buy. Finally, there is an output that
tells the user how long a Boeing 777 aircraft can fly with that amount of Fuel.
